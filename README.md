# TextQ Project

The project deals with the Quality of Experience of machine-generated texts. The focus lies on the two text types Machine Translation and Automatic Text Summarization. The goals of the project are to identify perceptive quality dimensions, to provide subjective methods for the quantification of the quality dimensions, to determine automatically extractable factors that correlate with text quality, and to develop prediction models that can assess the overall quality of a machine-generated text.
